# Cha-4

## Overview

Challenge 4 asks us to build a quiz application.

## Description

Within the quiz, there is a start button that initiates the test. Once intiated, a question and four options are presented to the user. There is also a next button (to switch the page) and there is a submit button (to submit score). Submissions are stored in the local storage (username and scoreTime).
